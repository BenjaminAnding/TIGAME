TI GAME  

A simple multi calculator TI-84 game built in TI Basic in my spare time between classes on ULL's campus.  

Data is transferred over IO cable or CBL2 interface.  

1. Start the program on both calculators simultaneously.  

2. Select a "secret" by pressing a (random) key on your calulator.  

3. After a secret has been selected, your calculator's ID (A or B) will be displayed at the top left of the screen.  

4. When the screen is blank, make your selection, then the screen will display your opponents selection (keys are mapped to the standard TI84 keymapping)  

5. If your secret is guessed, "You lose" will be displayed, press the ON key to break out of the program. If you won, bask in your victory and laugh at your opponents final futile selection (press ON to break out once you have finished gloating ;-)


Thanks to James Kanjo for coming up with the "Multi-Calculator core" code found on tibasicdev.wiki.com, as well as education.ti.com for the TI-Connect software, as well as their excellent documentation in the TI-83 manual as well as the TI-84+ and TI-84+ Silver Edition manual. All other code is strictly my own, and is being distributed under a creative commons MIT license.
